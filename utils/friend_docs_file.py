As usual I was a\nmember of the party, and my back still aches when I think of the hard\nwork I did to help load that monster aboard the _Hope_.\n\nIt was during this voyage that Commander Peary announced his\ndetermination to discover the North Pole, and the following years (from\n1898 to 1902) were spent in the Arctic.\n\nIn 1900, the American record of Farthest North, held by Lockwood and\nBrainard, was equaled and exceeded; their cairn visited and their\nrecords removed', "On April 21, 1902, a new American record of 84 17' was\nmade by Commander Peary, further progress north being frustrated by a\nlack of provisions and by a lane of open water, more than a mile wide.\nThis lead or lane of open water I have since become more familiarly\nacquainted with", 'We have called it many names, but it is popularly known\nas the "Big Lead." Going north, meeting it can be depended upon', 'It is\nsituated just a few miles north of the 84th parallel, and is believed to\nmark the continental shelf of the land masses in the Northern\nHemisphere.\n\nDuring the four years from 1898 to 1902, which were continuously spent\nin the regions about North Greenland, we had every experience, except\ndeath, that had ever fallen to the lot of the explorers who had preceded\nus, and more than once we looked death squarely in the face', 'Besides, we\nhad many experiences that earlier explorers did not meet', 'In January,\n1899, Commander Peary froze his feet so badly that all but one of his\ntoes fell off.\n\nAfter the return home, in 1902, it was three years before Commander\nPeary made another attack on the Pole, but during those years he was not\nresting.\n\nHe was preparing to launch his final and "sincerely to be hoped"\nsuccessful expedition, and in July, 1905, in the newly built ship,\n_Roosevelt_, we were again "Poleward-bound." The following September,\nthe _Roosevelt_ reached Cape Sheridan, latitude 82 27\' north, under her\nown steam, a record unequaled by any other vessel, sail or steam.\n\nEarly the next year, the negotiation of the Arctic Ocean was commenced,\nnot as oceans usually are negotiated, but as this ocean must be, by men,\nsledges, and dogs', 'The field party consisted of twenty-six men, twenty\nsledges, and one hundred and thirty dogs.\n\nThat was an open winter and an early spring, very desirable conditions\nin some parts of the world, but very undesirable to us on the northern\ncoast of Greenland', 'The ice-pack began disintegrating much too early\nthat year to suit, but we pushed on, and had it not been for furious\nstorms enforcing delays and losses of many precious days, the Pole would\nhave been reached', "As it was, Commander Peary and his party got to 87\n6' north, thereby breaking _all records_, and in spite of incredible\nhardships, hunger and cold, returned safely with all of the expedition,\nand on Christmas Eve the _Roosevelt_, after a most trying voyage,\nentered New York harbor, somewhat battered but still seaworthy.\n\nDespite the fact that it was to be his last attempt, Commander Peary no\nsooner reached home than he announced his intention to return, this time\nto be the last, and this time to win.\n\nHowever, a year intervened, and it was not until July 6, 1908, with the\nGod-Speed and good wishes of President Roosevelt, that the good ship\nnamed in his honor set sail again", "The narrative of that voyage, and the\nstory of the discovery of the North Pole, follow.\n\nThe ages of the wild, misgiving mystery of the North Pole are over,\nto-day, and forever it stands under the folds of Old Glory.\n\nJuly 6, 1908: We're off!

In 1823, twenty-seven years after Washington\'s celebrated\naddress, President Monroe in his annual message to Congress warned the\nEuropean Powers not to plant any new colonies on any portion of the\nAmerican hemisphere, as any attempt on their part to extend their\nsystem in that part of the world would be considered as dangerous to\nthe peace and safety of the United States', ' This "Monroe Doctrine", as\nit has since been called, practically protects every state and country\non the American continent from attack or interference by any foreign\npower, and it cannot be denied that it has been and is now the chief\nfactor in preserving the integrity of all the countries on that\ncontinent', ' Thus the United States is assuming the role of guardian\nover the other American nations', ' In the city of Washington there is an\nInternational Bureau of the American Republics, in which all the\nRepublics of Central and South America are represented', ' It is housed\nin a magnificent palace made possible by the beneficence of Mr', 'Andrew\nCarnegie, the American multi-millionaire and philanthropist, and the\ncontributions of the different governments', ' It cost 750,000 gold\ndollars, and Mr', 'John Barrett, the capable and popular director of the\nBureau, has well called it "a temple of friendship and commerce and a\nmeeting place for the American Republics."

In order to save the Executive of\nthe United States from embarrassment, the Chinese Government, contrary\nto its own sense of justice, and of international comity, for a third\ntime yielded to the wishes of the United States, and concluded the\namended treaty of 1894 which gave Congress additional power of\nlegislation respecting Chinese laborers', ' By Article I of this treaty\nit was agreed that for a term of ten years the coming of Chinese\nlaborers to the United States should be absolutely prohibited', ' Article\nIII distinctly provided that "the provisions of this convention shall\nnot affect the right at present enjoyed of Chinese subjects, being\nofficials, teachers, students, merchants, or travellers for curiosity\nor pleasure, but not laborers, of coming to the United States and\nresiding therein." Thus it is clear that the prohibition affects only\nlaborers, and not the other classes of Chinese', ' For a few years after\nthe signing of this convention this was the view adopted and acted upon\nby the immigration officials, but afterward they changed their\nattitude, and the foregoing Article has since been interpreted to mean\nthat only the above-mentioned five classes can be admitted into the\nUnited States, and that all the other classes of Chinese, however\nrespectable and honorable, must be refused admission', ' Will my readers\nbelieve that a Chinese banker, physician, lawyer, broker, commercial\nagent, scholar or professor could all be barred out of the United\nStates of America under the provisions of this convention?
